## Hi there! I'm Bekka! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Graphic Information Technology student at Arizona State University online! I study from afar, across the US in MA, where I spend my days working at Starbucks. When I'm not working or studying, you'll find me watching One Piece, crocheting, or out with my closest friends (who just so happen to be my favorite coworkers). :sparkles:

I chose GIT to study because I've always loved art, being on the internet, and combining my interests as simply as I can. I've always been intrigued by learning to code, and when I had the opportunity to at a previous school, it was my favorite part of the class. So, GIT felt like such a great way to learn new things while also combining things I already have a lot of room in my heart for!
I'm hoping to come up with a plan for after graduation in this field, as right at this moment I'm still figuring it out. :revolving_hearts:
